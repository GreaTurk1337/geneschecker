# **🧬 BadGenesChecker**  

A Python tool to analyze your DNA data by comparing it against **SNPedia** to identify potentially beneficial or harmful genes.  

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- ✅ Reads your DNA file (`raw.csv` or `dna.csv`).  
- ✅ Matches **rsid** and **genotype** with the SNPedia dataset.  
- ✅ Identifies **"Good"** or **"Bad"** genes based on SNPedia information.  
- ✅ Provides **direct links** to SNPedia for further research.
